# Introduction

## What is Frappe?

Frappe, pronounced _fruh-pay_, is a full stack, batteries-included, web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the backend. It is the framework which powers [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com). It is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.

The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that **meta-data** is also treated as data and is used to build front-ends very easily. We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you need to build a modern web application. It has a full blown Admin UI called the Desk that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.

Frappe is MIT Licensed and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/frappe/frapppe).

### Tutorial

Let's build a ToDo app in Frappe, but wait, it already exists in Frappe! (hint: batteries-included). So let's make something with some more complexity. We will be building a Discussion Forum where people will be able to login, create posts, comment on them and discuss topics.
