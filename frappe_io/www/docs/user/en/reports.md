# Reports

Frappe framework is best suited for business applications and reporting is an
important part of any business. Frappe supports 3 different ways to build
reports depending on their complexity.

Let's discuss each type and how to build them using Frappe.

## Report Builder

Report Builder is the simplest type of Report and can be created without any
code. It will only show the records of single DocType as well as child records of
Child Tables.

#### Saving Reports

By default a Report View is generated for all DocTypes. The user can also save
multiple Reports based on different combination of filters, ordering, columns,
etc.

#### Printing

Reports can be printed from the Menu.

#### Group By

You can also apply group by clause on columns and use aggregate functions like Count, Sum and Average.

#### Keyboard Navigation and Editing

Since report builder is a view of single DocType, they can also be edited.

## Query Report

Query Reports are reports that can be generated using a single SQL query. The
query can be simple or complex as long as it generates columns and records.
These reports can only be created by a System Manager and are stored in the database.

To create a Query Report, type "new report" in the awesomebar and hit enter.

1. Set Report Type as "Query Report"
1. Set the Reference DocType - Users that have access to the Reference DocType will have access to the report
1. Set the Module - The report will appear in the "Custom Reports" section of the module.
1. Write your query

> If you set Standard as "Yes" and Developer Mode is enabled, then a JSON file
> will be generated which you will have to check in to your version control. You
> should do this only if you want to bundle Query Reports with your app. The
> Module will decide where the JSON file will go.

![New Query Report](/docs/assets/img/query-report-example-1.png)

Here is what a query may look like:

```sql
SELECT
  `tabWork Order`.name as "Work Order:Link/Work Order:200",
  `tabWork Order`.creation as "Date:Date:120",
  `tabWork Order`.production_item as "Item:Link/Item:150",
  `tabWork Order`.qty as "To Produce:Int:100",
  `tabWork Order`.produced_qty as "Produced:Int:100",
  `tabWork Order`.company as "Company:Link/Company:"
FROM
  `tabWork Order`
WHERE
  `tabWork Order`.docstatus=1
  AND ifnull(`tabWork Order`.produced_qty,0) < `tabWork Order`.qty
  AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT name from `tabStock Entry` where work_order =`tabWork Order`.name)
```

If you notice there is a special syntax for each column, we use this information
to format the Report View.

For example: The first column `Work Order:Link/Work Order:200` will be rendered
as a Link Field with the DocType Work Order and the column width would be 200px.

## Script Report

Anything that can't be achieved using Report Builder or Query Report can be
achieved using Script Reports. As the name suggests, these reports are built
using Python scripts. Since these reports give you unrestricted access via
Python scripts, they can only be created by Administrators. These reports are
meant to be written during development and be a part of your app.

> To create Script Reports you must enable Developer Mode.

To create a Script Report, type "new report" in the awesomebar and hit enter.

1. Set Report Type as "Script Report"
1. Set "Is Standard" as "Yes"
1. Select the Module in which you want to add this report
1. In the module folder (for example if it is Accounts in ERPnext the folder
   will be `erpnext/accounts/report/[report-name]`) you will see that templates
   for the report files will be created.
1. Write your python script in the generated `{report-name}.py` file.
1. You can add filters to your report by adding them to `{report-name}.js`

#### Writing the script

The generated `.py` file comes with a boilerplate for your report. There is one
method named `execute` which takes `filters` and returns `columns` and `data`.
You can use any combination of python modules and SQL queries to generate your
report.

Here is what the shape of `columns` and `data` must look like:

```py
import frappe
from frappe import _

def execute(filters=None):
	columns = [
		{
			'fieldname': 'account',
			'label': _('Account'),
			'fieldtype': 'Link',
			'options': 'Account'
		},
		{
			'fieldname': 'currency',
			'label': _('Currency'),
			'fieldtype': 'Link',
			'options': 'Currency'
		},
		{
			'fieldname': 'balance',
			'label': _('Balance'),
			'fieldtype': 'Currency',
			'options': 'currency'
		}
	]

	data = [
		{
			'account': 'Application of Funds (Assets)',
			'currency': 'INR',
			'balance': '15182212.738'
		},
		{
			'account': 'Current Assets - GTPL',
			'currency': 'INR',
			'balance': '17117932.738'
		},
		...
	]

	return columns, data
```

Here is a script report from ERPNext: [Balance Sheet](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/blob/develop/erpnext/accounts/report/balance_sheet/balance_sheet.py)

#### Adding filters

To add filters in your report define the fields and their fieldtypes in the
`{report-name}.js` file. The filter values will be available in the `execute`
method as a dict.

```js
frappe.query_reports['Balance Sheet'] = {
	filters: [
		{
			fieldname: 'company',
			label: __('Company'),
			fieldtype: 'Link',
			options: 'Company',
			default: frappe.defaults.get_user_default('company')
		},
		{
			fieldname: 'periodicity',
			label: __('Periodicity'),
			fieldtype: 'Select',
			options: [
				'Monthly',
				'Quarterly',
				'Half-Yearly',
				'Yearly'
			],
			default: 'Yearly'
		}
	]
}
```

> *Protip*: To navigate directly to a Report of any of the above type, type its
> name in the awesomebar and hit enter.

## Query Report View

For both Query Reports and Script Reports the same UI view is used to render
them. So, both of them benefit from the UI features like Print, PDF, Export to
Excel/CSV, Auto Email Report, etc.
