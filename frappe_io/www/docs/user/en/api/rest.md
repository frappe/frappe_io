# REST API

Frappe framework generates REST API for all of your DocTypes out of the box. You
can also run arbitrary python methods using their dotted module path.

## Authentication

There are two ways to authenticate through Frappe REST API. Token based
authentication and password based authentication.

### 1. Token Based Authentication

A token is a pair of API Key and API Secret. First, you must create an API User
and then generate the keys in the **API Access** section in the User form.

The token is generated by concatenating `api_key` and `api_secret` with a colon
`:`. Pass the string `token api_key:api_secret` to the `Authorization` header in
the request.

```js
fetch('http://<base-url>/api/method/frappe.auth.get_logged_user', {
	headers: {
		'Authorization': 'token api_key:api_secret'
	}
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(r => {
	console.log(r);
})
```

### 2. Password Based Authentication

Password based authentication relies on cookies and session data to maintain
authentication in subsequent requests. In most cases, the library you are using
to issue REST calls will handle session data, but if it doesn't you should use
Token based authentication.

```js
fetch('http://<base-url>/api/method/login', {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: {
		'Accept': 'application/json',
		'Content-Type': 'application/json',
	},
	body: JSON.stringify({
		usr: 'username or email',
		pwd: 'password'
	})
})
.then(r => r.json())
.then(r => {
	console.log(r);
})
```

### Listing Documents

To get a list of records of a DocType, send a GET request at
`/api/resource/:doctype`. By default, it will return 20 records and will only
fetch the name of the records.

```sh
GET /api/resource/:doctype
```

Response
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "b57566801d"
    },
    {
      "name": "b63b71df37"
    },
    {
      "name": "1fea4af0f4"
    },
    {
      "name": "4ca0cc6e0e"
    },
  ]
}
```

You can specify which fields to fetch in the `fields` param. It should be a JSON array.

```sh
GET /api/resource/:doctype?fields=["field1", "field2"]
```

You can filter the records by passing `filters` param. Filters should be an
array, where each filter is of the format: `[field, operator, value]`

```sh
GET /api/resource/:doctype?filters=[["field1", "=", "value1"], ["field2", ">", "value2"]]
```

You can also provide the sort field and order. It should be of the format
`fieldname asc` or `fieldname desc`. The space should be URL encoded.

```sh
GET /api/resource/:doctype?order_by=title%20desc
```

You can also page the results by providing the `limit_start` and `limit_page_length` params.

```sh
GET /api/resource/:doctype?limit_start=10&limit_page_length=20
```

## CRUD Operations

Frappe generates REST endpoints for CRUD operations for all DocTypes
automatically. Make sure you set the following headers in your requests so that
you get proper JSON responses.

```json
{
	"Accept": "application/json",
	"Content-Type": "application/json",
}
```

### Create

Create a new document by sending a `POST` request to `/api/resource/:doctype`.
Send the document as JSON in the Request Body.

```sh
POST /api/resource/:doctype

# Body
{"description": "New ToDo"}
```

Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "af2e2d0e33",
    "owner": "Administrator",
    "creation": "2019-06-03 14:19:00.281026",
    "modified": "2019-06-03 14:19:00.281026",
    "modified_by": "Administrator",
    "idx": 0,
    "docstatus": 0,
    "status": "Open",
    "priority": "Medium",
    "description": "New ToDo",
    "doctype": "ToDo"
  }
}
```

### Read

Get a document by sending a `GET` request to `/api/resource/:doctype/:name`.

```sh
GET /api/resource/:doctype/:name
```

Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "bf2e760e13",
    "owner": "Administrator",
    "creation": "2019-06-03 14:19:00.281026",
    "modified": "2019-06-03 14:19:00.281026",
    "modified_by": "Administrator",
    "idx": 0,
    "docstatus": 0,
    "status": "Open",
    "priority": "Medium",
    "description": "<p>Test description</p>",
    "doctype": "ToDo"
  }
}
```

### Update

Update a document by sending a `PUT` request to `/api/resource/:doctype/:name`.
You don't need to send the whole document, instead you can just send the fields
that you want to update.

```sh
PUT /api/resource/:doctype/:name

# Body
{"description": "New description"}
```

Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "bf2e760e13",
    "owner": "Administrator",
    "creation": "2019-06-03 14:19:00.281026",
    "modified": "2019-06-03 14:21:00.785117",
    "modified_by": "Administrator",
    "idx": 0,
    "docstatus": 0,
    "status": "Open",
    "priority": "Medium",
    "description": "New description",
    "doctype": "ToDo"
  }
}
```

### Delete

Delete a document by sending a `DELETE` request to
`/api/resource/:doctype/:name`.

```sh
DELETE /api/resource/:doctype/:name
```

Response

```json
{"message": "ok"}
```

## Remote Method Calls

Frappe allows you to trigger arbitrary python methods using the REST API for
handling custom logic. These methods must be marked as *whitelisted* to make
them accessible via REST.

To run a whitelisted python method at `frappe.auth.get_logged_user`, send a
request to the endpoint `/api/method/frappe.auth.get_logged_user`.

```sh
GET /api/method/frappe.auth.get_logged_user
```

Response

```json
{
  "message": "john@doe.com"
}
```

- If your method returns some values, you should send a `GET` request.
- If your method changes the state of the database, use `POST`. After a
  successful `POST` request, the framework will automatically call
  `frappe.db.commit()` to commit the changes to the database.
- A successful response will return a JSON object with a `message` key.
- An errored response will return a JSON object with `exc` key which contains the
  stack trace and `exc_type` which contains the thrown Exception.
- The return value of the method will be converted to a JSON and sent as the
  response.
