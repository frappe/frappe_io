# Debugging

## Server

When you run the `bench start` command during development, the log from each
process of the Procfile is logged in the terminal window.

```sh
▶ bench start

```

When you write any print statements in your python code, it will show up in the
`web:` process log if it is a request/response, or in one of `worker_` processes
if the code runs in a background job.

> If you are a VSCode user, you can debug right in your editor by setting
breakpoints in your code. Follow these
[steps](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext/wiki/VSCode-Debugging-for-Frappe-Python)
to set it up.

### Console

To play with Python API, bench provides an iPython shell. After you run the
following command, it will import frappe, initialize it and also connect to
database.

```sh
▶ bench --site [sitename] console

In [1]: frappe.get_doc('Task', 'TASK00004')
Out[1]: <erpnext.projects.doctype.task.task.Task at 0x10825d710>
```

> Learn more about the Python API [here](/docs/user/en/api/python).

### Profiling

Bench's `execute` command runs a dotted path to method and it also supports
profiling.

```sh
bench --site [sitename] --profile execute erpnext.projects.doctype.task.task.set_tasks_as_overdue
```

## Client

Client side debugging is as simple as adding a `debugger` statement in your JS
file. You must open your DevTools in your browser for it to pause on the statement.

```js
frappe.db.get_value('Task', 'TASK00004', 'status')
	.then(values => {
		debugger
		console.log(values);
	})
```

### Console

To play with Client API, you can open your browser's console and use the
globally available `frappe` object to explore and run methods and access
properties.
