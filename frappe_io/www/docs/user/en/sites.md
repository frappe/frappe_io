# Sites

Frappe is a multitenant platform and each tenant is called a site. A site has
its own database. Sites exist in a directory called `sites`, assumed as the
current working directory when running a bench command.

## Sites Directory

The sites directory `frappe-bench/sites` is where all the sites for this bench
live. It also contains some other files and directories which are explained next.

### apps.txt

This file contains a list of Frappe apps. An app should be listed here before it
can be installed on a site. It is added automatically when `bench get-app`
command or `bench new-app` command is run.

### common\_site\_config.json

Configuration common to all sites can be put in this file. Learn more about
[site configuration]().

### assets

Assets contain files that are required to be served for the client browser.
These generally include *.js, *.css, and image files. This directory is auto
generated using the `bench build` command. This directory is served by Nginx in
production.

## Creating a new site

To create a new site, run the following command from the `frappe-bench` directory:

```sh
$ bench new-site mysite.local

Installing frappe...
Updating DocTypes for frappe        : [========================================]
Updating country info               : [========================================]
*** Scheduler is disabled ***
```

The `mysite.local` directory will now be created in the `sites` directory.

## Directory Structure

```sh
sites/mysite.local
├── locks
├── private
│   ├── backups
│   └── files
├── public
│   └── files
├── site_config.json
└── task-logs
```

### locks

This directory is used by the scheduler to synchronize various jobs using
the [file locking concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_locking).

### private

This directory contains files that require authentication to access. It contains
private files and backups. They can be accessed by the URL:
`/private/files/private-file.png`.

### public

This directory contains publicly accessible files. They can be accessed by the
URL: `/files/public-file.png`.

### site_config.json

This file contains site specific configuration.

## Site Config

A file named `site_config.json` exists in every site directory and is used to
store site specific configuration. The values are available in `frappe.conf`
local variable as a dict.

Example `site_config.json`:

```
{
	"db_name": "test_frappe",
	"db_password": "test_frappe",
	"admin_password": "admin",
}
```

Here is a list of all configuration options that can be specified:

## Site Resolution

While responding to an HTTP request, a site is automatically selected based on,

* `Host` header in the HTTP request matches a site
* `X-Frappe-Site-Name` header in the HTTP request matches a site

It is also possible to force the development server to serve a specific site by
starting it with the following command:

```sh
bench --site mysite.local serve
```

## Set a site as the current site

To force a site to be used as the default site, run the following command:

```sh
bench use mysite.local
```

After running this command, site specific commands can be run without the
`--site` parameter.

For example, instead of running:
```sh
bench --site mysite.local migrate
```

You can just run:
```sh
bench migrate
```
