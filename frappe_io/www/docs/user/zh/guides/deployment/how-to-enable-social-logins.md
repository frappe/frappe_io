# How To Enable Social Logins

Use Facebook, Google or GitHub authentication to login to Frappé, and your users will be spared from remembering another password.

The system uses the **Email Address** supplied by these services to **match with an existing user** in Frappé. If no such user is found, **a new user is created** of the default type **Website User**, if Signup is not disabled in Website Settings. Any System Manager can later change the user type from **Website User** to **System User**, so that the user can access the Desktop.

To enable these signups, you need to have **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from these authentication services for your Frappé site. The Client ID and Client Secret are to be set in Website > Setup > Social Login Keys. Here are the steps to obtain these credentials.

> Use **https://{{ yoursite }}** if your site is HTTPS enabled.
