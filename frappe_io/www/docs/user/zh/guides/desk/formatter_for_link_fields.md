# Formatter For Link Fields

In case where a code and a name is maintained for an entity, (for example for Employee there may be an Employee Code and Employee Name) and we want to show both the ID and name in a link field, we can make a formatter.

#### Example:

	frappe.form.link_formatters['Employee'] = function(value, doc) {
		if(doc.employee_name && doc.employee_name !== value) {
			return value + ': ' + doc.employee_name;
		} else {
			return value;
		}
	}

Notes:

1. Both the primary key (`name) and the descriptive name (e.g. `employee_name`) must be present in the document. The descriptive name field could be hidden
1. This needs to be loaded before the document is loaded and can be re-used for all forms. You can also add it in `build.json`
