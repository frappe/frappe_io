# Adding Custom Button To Form

To create a custom button on your form, you need to edit the javascript file associated to your doctype. For example, If you want to add a custom button to User form then you must edit `user.js`.

In this file, you need to write a new method `add_custom_button` which should add a button to your form.

#### Function Signature for `add_custom_button(...)`
    frm.add_custom_button(__(buttonName), function(){
      //perform desired action such as routing to new form or fetching etc.
    }, __(groupName));

#### Example-1: Adding a button to User form
We should edit `frappe\core\doctype\user\user.js`

    frappe.ui.form.on('User', {
    	refresh: function(frm) {
        ...
          frm.add_custom_button(__('Get User Email Address'), function(){
            frappe.msgprint(frm.doc.email);
        }, __("Utilities"));
        ...
      }
    });

You should be seeing a button on user form as shown below,
