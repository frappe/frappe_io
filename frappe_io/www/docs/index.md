# Introduction

Frappe, pronounced _fra-pay_, is a full stack, batteries-included,
web framework written in Python and Javascript with MariaDB as the database.
It is the framework which powers [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com).
It is pretty generic and can be used to build database driven apps.

The key difference in Frappe compared to other frameworks is that **meta-data**
is also treated as data and is used to build front-ends very easily.
We believe in a monolithic architecture, so Frappe comes with almost everything you
need to build a modern web application. It has a full blown Admin UI called the Desk
that handles forms, navigation, lists, menus, permissions, file attachment and much more out of the box.

Frappe is MIT Licensed and is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/frappe/frappe).
