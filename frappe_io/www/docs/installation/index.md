# Installation

> These steps assume you want to install Bench in developer mode. If you want install in production mode, follow the [Easy Install](https://github.com/frappe/bench#easy-install) method.

## System Requirements

This guide assumes you are using a personal computer, VPS or a bare-metal server. You also need to be on a *nix system, so any Linux Distribution and MacOS is supported. However, we officially support only the following distributions.

1. [MacOS](#macos)
1. [Debian / Ubuntu](#debian-ubuntu)
1. [Arch Linux](#arch-linux)
1. CentOS

> Learn more about the architecture [here](/docs/installation/architecture).

## Pre-requisites

1. Python 2.7 (Python 3.5+ also supported)
1. MariaDB 10+
1. Nginx (for production)
1. Git
1. Nodejs
1. yarn
1. Redis
1. cron (crontab is required)
1. wkhtmltopdf with patched Qt (version 0.12.3) (for pdf generation)

### MacOS

Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). It makes it easy to install packages on macOS.

```bash
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

Now, you can easily install the required packages by running the following command

```bash
brew install python
brew install git
brew install redis
brew install mariadb

brew tap caskroom/cask
brew cask install wkhtmltopdf
```

**Install Node**

We recommend installing node using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

After nvm is installed, you may have to close your terminal and open another one. Now run the following command to install node.

```bash
nvm install 8
```

Verify the installation, by running:

```bash
node -v
# output
v8.11.3
```

Finally, install yarn using npm

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

### Debian / Ubuntu

Install `git`, `python`, and `redis`

```bash
sudo apt install git python-dev redis-server
```

**Install MariaDB**

```bash
sudo apt-get install software-properties-common
sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xF1656F24C74CD1D8
sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,i386,ppc64el] http://ftp.ubuntu-tw.org/mirror/mariadb/repo/10.3/ubuntu xenial main'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server-10.3
```

During this installation you'll be prompted to set the MySQL root password. If you are not prompted, you'll have to initialize the MySQL server setup yourself. You can do that by running the command:

```bash
mysql_secure_installation
```

> Remember: only run it if you're not prompted the password during setup.

It is really important that you remember this password, since it'll be useful later on. You'll also need the MySQL database development files.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
```

Now, edit the MariaDB configuration file.

```bash
sudo nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

And add this configuration

```hljs
[mysqld]
character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8mb4
```

Now, just restart the mysql service and you are good to good

```bash
sudo service mysql restart
```

**Install Node**

We recommend installing node using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash
```

After nvm is installed, you may have to close your terminal and open another one. Now run the following command to install node.

```bash
nvm install 8
```

Verify the installation, by running:

```bash
node -v
# output
v8.11.3
```

Finally, install `yarn` using `npm`

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

**Install wkhtmltopdf**

```
sudo apt-get install xvfb libfontconfig wkhtmltopdf
```

### Arch Linux

Install packages using pacman

```bash
pacman -Syu
pacman -S mariadb redis python2-pip wkhtmltopdf git npm cronie nginx openssl
npm install -g yarn
```

Setup MariaDB

```bash
mysql_install_db --user=mysql --basedir=/usr --datadir=/var/lib/mysql
systemctl start mariadb
mysql_secure_installation
```

Edit the MariaDB configuration file

```bash
nano /etc/mysql/my.cnf
```

Add the following configuration

```
[mysqld]
innodb-file-format=barracuda
innodb-file-per-table=1
innodb-large-prefix=1
character-set-client-handshake = FALSE
character-set-server = utf8mb4
collation-server = utf8mb4_unicode_ci

[mysql]
default-character-set = utf8mb4
```

Start services

```bash
systemctl start mariadb redis
```

If you don't have cron service enabled you would have to enable it.

```bash
systemctl enable cronie
```

## Install Bench

Install bench as a non-root user

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frappe/bench bench-repo
pip install --user -e bench-repo
```

Confirm the bench installation by checking version

```bash
bench --version

# output
4.1.0
```

Create your first bench folder.

```bash
cd ~
bench init frappe-bench
```

After the frappe-bench folder is created, change your directory to it and run this command

```bash
bench start
```

Congratulations, you have installed bench on to your system.
